# FizzBuzzEnterprise Lite

This is a coding exercise for a software development company. 

Most people interested in software development these days have encountered FizzBuzz as either an interview question or have heard stories about it. Many hopeful developers have memorized the gist of the problem.

Let's say the big day arrives, and your interview question is about FizzBuzz. Maybe it's been a little bit since you've implemented FizzBuzz so you stumble trying to bring it up from memory, but it all works out. 

Great. Here's the next question: what if this had to exist in production somewhere? While not facetious like [FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition](https://github.com/EnterpriseQualityCoding/FizzBuzzEnterpriseEdition), this exercise will be used in a similar manner. Hopefully it will serve to demonstrate general knowledge and awareness of workplace software development, understanding of the tools and features available in C#, and problem-solving skills.

## More Information

While I've strived to ensure that the code in this project is well-documented, I'll be including some extra Markdown files to talk about my approach to the tasks I was given. I'll copy the contents of it to the Wiki section on GitHub as well.
